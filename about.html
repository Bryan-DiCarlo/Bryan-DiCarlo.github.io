<p>I entered the field of Data Science coming from a background in biomedical research. I spent numerous years investigating a diverse range of topics from Stem Cell Biology to Tissue Engineering.  I decided to enter the field of Data Science when I realized the tools I was accustomed to analyzing data with were no longer adequate to handle the explosion in data seen in all fields.  I have become fascinated with harnessing the power of programming  languages like Python, Machine Learning and the numerous other tools available to the Data Scientist.  My primary driver and motivation is unchanged. Answering questions and finding useful insight  into problems that, as of yet, have no answers. Everyone has access to the same tools. In Data Science, as in Science, the art is in using those tools to ask the right questions.</p>
