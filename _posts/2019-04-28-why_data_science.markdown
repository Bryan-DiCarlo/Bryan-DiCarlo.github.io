I come to Data Science from a background in Biomedical research.  If a tag or label is needed, I suppose my previous field of expertise would be considered Molecular Biology.  However, as a scientist I investigated a wide range of topics from Neuroscience to Stem Cell Biology to Tissue Engineering. And a few others in between.  Not too surprisingly a primary role of a scientist is gathering and analyzing data. However, in the past the amount of data analyzed was relatively small in comparison to the vast data sets generated today, not just in science, but in every field imaginable.  In the past researchers spent much of their time doing experiments.  These experiments are both time consuming and costly to perform.  I am generalizing of course, but the result was data sets that are small. Several spreadsheets of data as opposed to entire databases.  The analysis involved some of the same techniques used by todays Data Scientist. Linear regression, analysis of variance and hypothesis testing to name a few.  However, most of this analysis could be handled with basic spreadsheets and statistical software.

So why Data Science?  I became fascinated with Data Science when I realized the tools that I was accustomed to analyzing data with were no longer adequate.  The sheer amount of data in every field has exploded. Exponentially would not be an overstatement.  The sciences notwithstanding.  As technology has expanded along with readily available and affordable computing.  So has the amount of data.  For example, with the advent of automated DNA sequencing, the Human Genome Project no longer involved several spreadsheets worth of data.  Realizing the methods of analysis, I was accustomed to were no longer adequate to handle some of the new problems presented with this information explosion I began to investigate.

 	I wanted to harness the power of programming languages like Python, Machine Learning and all the other powerful tools at the Data Scientists disposal.  It became clear to me that these tools would be indispensable in investigating the kinds of problems I am interested in investigating.  Again, to use an example from my past work.  In a company I worked for previously we were analyzing 2-dimensional protein patterns of patients that had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.  In order to develop a diagnostic tool for detecting the disease.  Image analysis and pattern recognition basically.  However, since the field of Machine Learning and image analysis were not at the level, they are today we were relegated to using basic statistical software and manual visual analysis.  Spoiler, we did not find an effective diagnostic tool for Alzheimer’s Disease.  I can’t help from wondering if our fortunes would have been different if those tools would have been at our disposal.  I know labs are using those very technologies right now to investigate the same problem.

My motivation to become a Data Scientist is my love of finding answers to questions that do not have answers.  Data Science offers a virtually unlimited number of important questions that need valid answers. And the tools to find those answers.  Collecting large amounts of data has limited usefulness if valuable insight cannot be garnered from that data.  That being said.  Everyone has access to the same tools of analysis.  The true art of Data Science is the ability to ask the right questions.  I have that insatiable curiosity to ask those questions.  There are an ever-growing set of tools available to the Data Scientist that make answers to those questions possible.  That is what makes Data Science so compelling to me.
